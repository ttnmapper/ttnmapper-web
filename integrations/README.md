# Integration endpoints

## TTN and TTI (both referring to v2)

The difference between TTN and TTI is that on TTN we have stricter filters on the data as the sources can't neccesarily be trusted.
On TTI we don't require a user to identify themselves.

## TTS aka V3

TTN v3 and a private V3 instance look exactly the same. For now we can drop the filters, until it becomes neccesary.
